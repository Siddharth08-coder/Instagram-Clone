# Instagram-Clone
Clone of Android Instagram App using AWS instance server.  

This clone comprises of the the version I first used of Instagram when I created my account on it back in year 2015. During those times instagram was just an another app to share pictures among your friends and so this clone comprises just the property of instagram of sharing pictures. 

One can sign-up OR login through the first interface and his/her data(username) will be saved in the server. The server I have used is the "Parse by Bitnami" which is accompanied by Amazon EC2 AWS Instance. The photo which is to be uploaded can be choosen through gallery of the android phone and after uploading it is stored at the server which can be fetched by his/her friends anytime.


*NOTE:* This app was created as a practise project by Siddharth Singh and does not hold any licence for the usage of photos or logos. Also the app was created with great patience and help from various resources available online.

Thank You.
